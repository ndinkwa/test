CREATE CREDENTIALS FOR POSTGRES ON LDAP

SETUP POSTGRES(ONLINUX) TO AUTHENTICATE FROM WINDOWS

1- Inter-change the servers IP (DNS) addresses e.g

LDAP/AD Server IP = 192.167.0.122 ldap.bazefiled.hopto.org
PostgreSQL server IP = 10.253.193.43 postgres.bazefield.hopto.org

On linux Postgres

#vi /etc/hosts   and paste

--192.167.0.122 ldap.bazefiled.hopto.org
--10.253.193.43 postgres.bazefield.hopto.org

ON windows:
#local disk(C:)windows\system32\drivers\etc   open via notepad as admin and paste

--192.167.0.122 ldap.bazefiled.hopto.org
--10.253.193.43 postgres.bazefield.hopto.org

#on windows --ping postgres.bazefield.hopto.org
#on linux  --ping ldap.bazefield.hopto.org           =  To make sure they're responding


2- Open Server Manager on windows
   -click on Add roles and features and take next - next, you should see your LDAP server if already configured and next
make sure -Active Directory Domain Services, -DHCP Server, -DNS Server, -File and Storage Services are checked to be installed, next -Group Policy Management, .NET Framework 3.5 Features, -.Net Framework 4.7 Features(includes. NET 2.0 and 3.0) should also be  checked for installation & click next and the installation process will start.

  -Once completed, click on the retangular icon at the top and click on "promote this server to a domain controller" and check 'Add a new forest'. On Root domain name: put your domain 
name e.g bazefield.hopto.org and next, then it will request for a password: put in your password and next and wait for it to automatically display our NetBIOS domain name: e,g BAZEFIELD
then take next, next, next and wait for the prerequisites check and click install if all passed. Once installation is complete, it will restart.

Once done, click on tools on the Server Manager to check for -Active Directory Users and Computers.

-Click on Active Directory Users and Computers, you should be able to see your DNS name e.g bazefield.hopto.org.
-Click on your DNS and select -Users, right click on -Administrator User and take copy to create a "New User"  

e.g First name: jayson Last name: brain Userlogon name: jaysonbrain@bazefield.hopto.org, next -password and next - finish to create 


3- On your LDAP server open powershell and exec the following to generate a keytab file which will be copied to our PostgreSQL server:

#setspn -S POSTGRES/postgres.bazefield.hopto.org@bazefield.hopto.org jaysonbrain

------bazefield.hopto = your domain controller
------jaysonbrain     = your ldap admin user

#setspn -S HOST/postgres.basefield.hopto.org@bazefield.hopto.org jaysonbrain

#ktpass /out jayson.keytab /princ POSTGRES/ostgres.bazefield.hopto.org@basefiled.hopto.org /mapuser jaysonbrain@bazefield.hopto.org /pass Postgres134 /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL

-----Make sure your keytab files appears on the desktop (jayson.keytab file)

#setspn -L jaysonbrain == To list all what you have as admin

#Copy the keytab file to our postgres server. -You can use WINSCP to ship the file.


ON POSTGRES SERVER.

#cd to the location of your keytab file (jayson.keytab) e.d Data directory -/pgdata

#chmod 0600 jayson.keytab

1- put the file the postgresql.conf file

#vi postgresql.conf  and search for #krb_server_keyfile = '/usr/pgdata/jayson.keytab/' and !wq to save changes.

#restart the postgres server


#sudo systemctl start postgresql-15.service

#show krb_server_keyfile;
#show listen_addresses;

#create user "jaysonbrain@bazefield.hopto.org" superuser createrole createdb; - This user exit in my LDAP/AD already. Don't specify any password as it's going to be authenticated 
from LDAP.

2- Edit the HBA.CONF file

#vi hba.conf

Make sure your postgresql software version has GSS which is from 12v and above.

#rpm -qa |grep postgres = to check the software version to make sure there's "hostnogssenc" in the hba.conf. This is from 12v and above

Put the following rules in the hba.conf file:

# host     all         all         0.0.0.0/0       gss   include_realm=1 krb_realm=BAZEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG    -:wq and exit

#which psql = to check the path.
#export PATH=/usr/pgdata:$PATH

Restrt postgres

#sudo systemctl start postgresql-15.service

3- Install the krb5 package

#yum install krb5-server krb5-workstation pam-krb5

#ll /etc/krb*  to check for --/etc/krb5.conf-- file.

#vi /etc/krb5.conf  -- To point the file to the direction of yoour domain controller.

     -Uncomment -default_realm=BAZEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG

[realms]


BASEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG = {
kdc = ldap.bazefield.hopto.org
admin_server = ldap.bazefield.hopto.org
}

[domain_realm]
.bazefield.hopto.org = BAZEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG
bazefield.hopto.org.HOPTO.ORG

after editing the above mentioned files, save and exit -:wq

#kinit jayson@BAZEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG = To initailizedand  verify login using AD password (i.e obtain ticket)

#klist   =   To check if you obtained a ticket from your domain controller.


Once you obtained your ticket, you can connect to your database as below:


#psql -h postgres.bazefield.hopto.org -p 5432 -d postgres -U jayson@BAZEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG ==Here the credential is obtained from the domain controller(LDAP/AD)


For subsequent users,
e.g:

#create user "testuser@basefield.hopto.org" supperuser;

On windows navigate to "Domain controller - I.E Active Directory Users and Computers - Users, right click and select user to create new user by name =testuser and password

In order to add the new user, do the following:

#kdestroy -A  = To clear the cache

#klist   = To make sure no user exist

#kinit testuser@basefield.hopto.org  = To initialized the user to obtain the TGT (krbtgt) for the user.
