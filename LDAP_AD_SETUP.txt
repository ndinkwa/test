CREATE CREDENTIALS FOR POSTGRES ON LDAP

SETUP POSTGRES(ONLINUX) TO AUTHENTICATE FROM WINDOWS

1- Inter-change the servers IP (DNS) addresses e.g

LDAP/AD Server IP = 192.167.0.122 ldap.basefiled.hopto.org
PostgreSQL server IP = 192.167.0.165 postgres.basefield.hopto.org

On linux Postgres

#vi /etc/hosts   and paste

--192.167.0.122 ldap.basefiled.hopto.org
--192.167.0.165 postgres.basefield.hopto.org

ON windows:
#local disk(C:)windows\system32\drivers\etc   open via notepad as admin and paste

--192.167.0.122 ldap.basefiled.hopto.org
--192.167.0.165 postgres.basefield.hopto.org

#on windows --ping postgres.basefield.hopto.org
#on linux  --ping ldap.basefiled.hopto.org

To make sure they're responding


2- Open Server Manager on windows
   -click on Add roles and features and take next and next, you should see your LDAP server if already configured and take next
make sure -Active Directory Domain Services is checked, next -group policy management, .NET Framework 3.5(includes. NET 2.0 and 3.0) should be  and checked here & click next
and the installation process will start.

  -Once completed, click on the retangular icon at the top and click on "promote this server to a domain controller" and check 'Add a new forest'. On Root domain name: put your domain 
name e.g basefield.hopto.org and next, then it will request for a password: put in your password and next and wait for it to automatically display our NetBIOS domain name: e,g BASEFIELD
then take next, next, next and wait for the prerequisites check and click install if all passed. Once installation is complete, it will restart.

Once done, click on tools on the Server Manager to check for -Active Directory Users and Computers.

-Click on Active Directory Users and Computers, you should be able to see your DNS name e.g basefiled.hopto.org


3- On your LDAP server open powershell and exec the following:

#setspn -S POSTGRES/postgres.basefield.hopto.org@basefiled.hopto.org jaysonbrain

------basefiled.hopto = your domain controller
------jaysonbrain     = your ldap admin user

#setspn -S HOST/postgres.basefield.hopto.org@basefiled.hopto.org jaysonbrain

#ktpass /out jayson.keytab /princ POSTGRES/ostgres.basefield.hopto.org@basefiled.hopto.org /mapuser jaysonbrain@basefiled.hopto.org /pass Postgres134 /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL

-----Make sure your keytab files appears on the desktop (jayson.keytab file)

#setspn -L jaysonbrain == To list all what you have as admin

#Copy the keytab file to our postgres server.


ON POSTGRES SERVER.

#cd to the location of your keytab file (jayson.keytab)

#chmod 0600 jayson.keytab

1- put the file the postgresql.conf file

#vi postgresql.conf  and search for #krb_server_keyfile = '/usr/pgdata/jayson.keytab/' and !wq to save changes.

#restart the postgres server


#sudo systemctl start postgresql-15.service

#show krb_server_keyfile;

#create user "jaysonbrain@basefiled.hopto.org" superuser createrole createdb;

2- Edit the HBA.CONF file

#vi hba.conf

#rpm -qa |grep postgres = to check the software version to make sure there's "hostnogssenc" in the hba.conf. This is from 12v and above

Put the following rules in the hba.conf file:

# host     all         all         0.0.0.0/0       gss   include_realm=1 krb_realm=BASEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG    -wq! and exit

#which psql = to check the path.
#export PATH=/usr/pgdata:$PATH

Restrt postgres

#sudo systemctl start postgresql-15.service

3- Install the krb5 package

#yum install krb5-server krb5-workstation pam-krb5

#ll /etc/krb*  to check for --/etc/krb5.conf-- file.

#vi /etc/krb5.conf  -- To point the file to the direction of yoour domain controller.

     -Uncomment #default_realm=BASEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG

[realms]


BASEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG = {
kdc = ldap.basefiled.hopto.org
admin_server = ldap.basefiled.hopto.org
}

[domain_realm]
.basefield.hopto.org = BASEFIELD.HOPTO.ORG
basefield.hopto.org.HOPTO.ORG

after editing the above mentioned files, save and exit wq!
